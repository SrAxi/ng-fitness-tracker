# NgFitnessTracker

This project's goal is mainly to learn to use Store within **Angular** projects using **Ngrx**.

It's also a project where CSS is being refreshed by using **Flexbox** and **Angular Material**.

The use of **Firebase** as a database, API and hosting tool was a casual yet incredible and useful discovery in this project.
