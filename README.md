# NgFitnessTracker

This project's goal is to refresh the knowledge in using Angular-CLI and Angular 5+, and mainly to learn to use Store within Angular projects using Ngrx.
It's also a project where CSS is being refreshed by using Flex-layout and Angular Material.
The use of Firebase was a casual yet incredible and useful discovery in this project.
